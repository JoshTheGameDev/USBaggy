## Read Me First

Warning for unity 5.6 users.  

The newest version of textmesh pro makes a few big changes, which breaks the textmesh pro playmaker actions. They did NOT use conditionals, and instead released a new version only for 5.6. You can see the list of changes here: http://digitalnativestudios.com/forum/index.php?topic=1363.msg10122#msg10122  

Currently my actions do not support this new version (only available for 5.6) if you are updated to textmesh pro version 1.0.55 and above.  

I will likely add support, but maybe not for a few weeks or more.

## Bugs & Updates

Currently no major bugs have been reported, however this is a work in progress. If you experience errors with this playmaker action set, please don't hesitate to contact me at tcmeric@gmail.com for further assistance.

Keep a special eye on the playmaker actions for shaders. This is a tricky area, especially for mobile shaders. Again, if any issues arise, please don't hesitate to report it so corrections can be made.
